# SMART SCHEME PROJECT REPORT

## ABSTRACT

The "SMART SCHEME" portal is an innovative digital platform designed to connect Tamil Nadu citizens with government welfare schemes efficiently. By leveraging modern web technologies and AI-powered assistance, the system centralizes scheme information, simplifies application processes, and enhances accessibility for all eligible residents. The portal aims to address the challenges of fragmented information, manual processes, and lack of personalized guidance, ensuring that government benefits reach the intended beneficiaries seamlessly.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Government welfare schemes are crucial for the socio-economic development of citizens. However, the lack of a unified platform often leads to confusion, inefficiency, and underutilization of these schemes. The SMART SCHEME portal is developed to overcome these challenges by providing a centralized, user-friendly, and intelligent interface for scheme discovery, eligibility checking, and application submission.

### 1.1 PROJECT PROFILE

- **Project Title:** SMART SCHEME Portal
- **Domain:** E-Governance, Welfare Scheme Management
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Gemini AI API
- **Target Users:** Tamil Nadu citizens, government administrators

## 2. SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### 2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM

The current system for accessing government schemes is highly fragmented. Information is scattered across multiple websites, documents, and offline sources. Citizens face several issues:
- **Lack of Centralization:** No single source for all schemes.
- **Complex Navigation:** Multiple portals and manual visits required.
- **Limited Awareness:** Many citizens remain unaware of their eligibility.
- **Manual Application:** Paper-based processes are time-consuming and error-prone.
- **No Personalized Guidance:** Users struggle to identify suitable schemes.

### 2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed SMART SCHEME portal addresses these limitations by:
- **Centralizing Scheme Information:** All schemes are listed in one portal.
- **Advanced Search and Filters:** Users can easily find relevant schemes.
- **AI Chatbot Assistance:** Provides instant, personalized guidance.
- **Digital Application Process:** Streamlines application submission and tracking.
- **Admin Management:** Secure backend for administrators to manage scheme data.

### 2.3 SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

- **Hardware Requirements:** Standard PC or mobile device, internet connectivity.
- **Software Requirements:** Modern web browser, Node.js runtime, MongoDB database.

#### 2.3.3 ABOUT THE SOFTWARE

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for responsive UI.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user, scheme, and application data.
- **AI Integration:** Gemini API for chatbot support.

## 3. SYSTEM DESIGN

### 3.1 ER DIAGRAM

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) models the core entities and their relationships in the SMART SCHEME portal:

- **User:** Represents citizens and admins, with attributes like user_id, name, email, and role.
- **Scheme:** Contains scheme_id, name, eligibility, and benefits.
- **Application:** Links users to schemes, storing application details.
- **Document:** Represents documents required for scheme applications.

#### DFD Level 1 (Decomposition of SMART SCHEME)

Level 1 DFD breaks down the main system into subprocesses such as viewing schemes, managing schemes, validating users, and chatbot interaction. It also shows the flow of data between users, admins, databases, and the chatbot.

#### DFD Level 2 (Decomposition of SMART SCHEME)

Level 2 DFD further decomposes a key process (e.g., document validation) into detailed subprocesses, showing how documents are validated, eligibility is checked, and applications are stored.
